# Environ_Code
Environ is an application that allows social media for the environment. I built this website along with another Kode with Klossy, Sadie Keil. 


You can view the deployed website here: https://environleaf.glitch.me/ 

We won the GM STEM for Changemaking Challenge, and plan to use the funds to expand and launch Environ. Learn more about the winners here: https://network.changemakers.com/challenge/our-planet-our-purpose-2021/winners-announced/environ-siri-sadie
